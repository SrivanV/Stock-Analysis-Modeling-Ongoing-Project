# Stock-Analysis-and-Modeling-ONGOING
An ongoing study &amp; exploration of stocks using various Data Science concepts. I have numerous goals with this project but the 2 main goals are: 
- Use the data to better understand the complex world of stock trading from a total beginner's perspective
- Apply my knowledge of Data Science in order to utilize the full potential of the data that I am able to pull (using the **QuandL** API)
